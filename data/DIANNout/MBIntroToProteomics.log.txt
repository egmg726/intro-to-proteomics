Thread number set to 30
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
Cysteine carbamidomethylation enabled as a fixed modification
MBR enabled; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first pass
The spectral library (if generated) will retain the original spectra but will include empirically-aligned RTs
Mass accuracy will be fixed to 2e-05 (MS2) and 1.2e-05 (MS1)
WARNING: protein inference is enabled but no FASTA provided - is this intended?
